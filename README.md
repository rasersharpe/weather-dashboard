## Description

The Weather Dashboard is a pleasing weather app. It displays the current weather and 5 day forecast for a city of your choosing. It will also add your city search history to the webpage.

Building this app taught me to use API's, and create the relationship between client side and server side functionality.

## Installation

This is a web app so you just need to navigate to the webpage in your browser.

## Usage

Enter the city of your choice in the search field and click Search. Once you've amassed a search history, click on one of the city buttons to see that city's weather info.

## Collaborators

For this project, I sought help from the Xpert Learning Assistant and a very helpful tutor, Kayvon, to help me understand the core concepts that go in to an app like this.
